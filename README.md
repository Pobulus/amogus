## Compiling
It only worked with clang++ which is kinda sus.
- client:
`clang++ -lncursesw amogus.cpp main.cpp -o amogus`
- server:
`clang++ amogus-server-main.cpp -o server`

## Usage 
First start up the server:
`./server`<br>
Then connect your client like so:
`./amogus -i <ip address>`<br>
(it uses port 8888 but you don't have to specify it anywhere)<br>
You can also connect by tellnet, but it is unreadable.
